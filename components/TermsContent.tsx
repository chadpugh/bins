Seller agrees that Bins will not be liable for: (a) any defects or nonconformities in Seller's Products; (b) any failure or delay in the delivery of Products to the Buyer; (c) any failure of Seller's Products to comply with applicable regulations or laws. When a Buyer places an Order for Seller's Product, Seller will be notified via email and the Order details will be displayed on Seller's dashboard on the Service. When an Order is placed for Seller's Products through the Service, we will provide the shipping and billing information to Seller. Once we provide this information to Seller, Seller agrees to ship the Products that the Buyer has purchased to the shipping address provided by the Buyer.

If a Product is not delivered or shipped within a reasonable period after the submission of an Order, as determined by Bins in its sole discretion, Bins may issue a refund to the applicable Buyer. Seller agrees to promptly respond to any requests from Buyers related to its Products, including any requests related to returns. Seller is solely responsible for resolving any dispute that Seller may have with a Buyer, including any dispute related to refunds or returns.

                <strong>Payment Terms.</strong> To ensure proper payment, Seller is responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information through the Service. All payments made by Bins to Seller under these Terms will be made in U.S. Dollars. We will temporarily not release the Product Revenue for each of Seller's Products that a Buyer purchased through Service until one day after the date on which delivery of the Product to the Buyer's shipping address is confirmed by the applicable carrier. "<strong>Product Revenue</strong>" means the amount paid by a Buyer and received by Bins for the sale of Seller's Product pursuant to a valid Order, less: (a) the Marketplace Fee, (b) shipping or handling fees paid by the Buyer, (c) refunds, returns, credits, chargebacks, fraudulent transactions related to the Product, if any. [Seller is solely responsible for payment of all taxes, duties, and other governmental charges collected by Bins in connection with the sale of Products, including sales taxes and value-added taxes, and any costs related to calculating and collecting such taxes related to the sale of the Products.] Bins or its Payment Processor reserves the right to not authorize or settle any payment Bins believes is in violation of these Terms or is fraudulent. If Seller cannot provide proof that a Product was delivered by the applicable carrier, Bins will have no obligation to pay the Product Revenue.

                  <strong>Receipt of Product Revenue.</strong> Provided that there is not a dispute between the Buyer and Seller, Product Revenue will be available to Seller as specified by the Payment Processor. If Seller has linked Seller's bank account with Seller's Payment Processor account, Seller may transfer the Product Revenue to Seller's bank account. Seller may need to provide certain banking information and authorizations to the Payment Processor in order to link Seller's bank account. Seller may elect to use its unclaimed Product Revenue to purchase Products sold by other Sellers. If Seller uses unclaimed Product Revenue as a payment method, Bins may offset such amount from Product Revenue that is otherwise payable to Seller and direct the Payment Processor to transfer such funds to Bins. In order to receive seller's product revenue to seller's bank account, seller is required to set up an account with the payment processor and link seller's bank account. Seller will not be able to transfer any funds to seller's bank account unless seller has a valid payment processor account and linked bank account.

                  <strong>Payment Exceptions.</strong> Bins or its Payment Processor may, in its sole discretion, exclude, or withhold from any payment due to Seller any amount: (a) received in connection with a violation of these Terms; (b) that Bins believes to be fraudulent; or (c) as necessary to comply with any law, rule, or regulation. Bins will pay Seller any amounts owed under these Terms to the payment method that you choose from the payment options made available through the Service. At any time, Bins may offset fees and any other amounts owed by Seller to Bins against amounts Bins owes to Seller hereunder. If any excess payment has been made to Seller for any reason whatsoever, Bins reserves the right to adjust or offset the same against any subsequent amounts payable to Seller under these Terms.

                  <strong>Boost Feature.</strong> As part of the Service, Seller may increase the number of users that are able to view Seller's Products that are listed on the Service by paying an additional fee ("<strong>Boost Feature</strong>"). The Boost Feature is provided as described on our service. If Seller would like to enable the Boost Feature for a particular Product, Seller will be charged a per Product fee ("<strong>Boost Fee</strong>"). Seller will have an opportunity to view the Boost Fee for a Product when the Seller enables the feature on the Service. Seller authorizes Bins or its Payment Processors to charge the Boost Fee, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in Seller's account. If Seller's selected payment method is a credit card, Bins or our Payment Processors may seek pre-authorization of Seller's credit card account prior to Seller's purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover Seller's purchase. Bins does not guarantee any Product will sell quicker (or at all) or that a Product will sell for a higher price as a result of Seller's use of the Boost Feature.
